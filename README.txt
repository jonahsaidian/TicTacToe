Here is a simple code which will run TicTacToe using Python 3.7

Required packages are Tkinter and Random, both of which come with standard releases of python. otherwise each script is entirely standalone

I have included 3 versions of the game here with steady progress between each version


Changelog:
V3:
This update was largely aesthetic
font sizes were increased to make the notes more obvious and readable
flare was added to make a win or lose more noticable
added keybinding to allow for restart and quit at any point during the game
code was reworked again to be neater and easier to look through

V2:
The AI has been updated to actually strategize and provide a challenging opponent
minor changes in how the game is run to clean up the code

V1:
first stable build of the game. the code is working and can play the game with a very simplistic AI that chooses its moves randomly from the available moveslist
